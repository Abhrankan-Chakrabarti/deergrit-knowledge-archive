<h2>About DEERGRIT</h2>

<p>
DEERGRIT is a quiet, read-only knowledge archive designed to explain how modern digital systems work. It exists to preserve clear, factual explanations of topics that often remain hidden behind complexity, marketing language, or assumed knowledge.
</p>

<p>
The project is intentionally simple. It does not track users, collect data, or require interaction. All content is delivered as static text, allowing it to remain accessible, stable, and resistant to change over time.
</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>
Digital systems increasingly shape how people communicate, learn, and make decisions. Yet the underlying structures of these systems are rarely explained in plain terms. DEERGRIT aims to reduce this gap by documenting foundational concepts in a calm and neutral way.
</p>

<p>
Rather than focusing on news, trends, or opinions, the archive concentrates on mechanisms: how data moves, how platforms are structured, how incentives influence design, and how users can better understand the environments they operate within.
</p>

<h3>Why Tor</h3>

<p>
DEERGRIT is hosted as a Tor onion service to emphasize accessibility and decentralization. Onion services allow information to be published without reliance on large platforms or centralized hosting providers.
</p>

<p>
The choice of Tor is not ideological. It reflects a preference for infrastructure that prioritizes resilience, privacy, and long-term availability.
</p>

<h3>What DEERGRIT Is Not</h3>

<p>
DEERGRIT is not a personal blog, a political platform, or a call to action. It does not promote movements, campaigns, or specific viewpoints. The archive does not host leaks, confidential material, or user-generated content.
</p>

<p>
Its role is explanatory, not persuasive.
</p>

<h3>Long-Term Intent</h3>

<p>
The content of DEERGRIT is designed to remain relevant over time. By avoiding dependency on current events and external services, the archive can function as a stable reference regardless of changes in the broader digital landscape.
</p>

<p>
All content is released into the public domain to encourage preservation, mirroring, and reuse.
