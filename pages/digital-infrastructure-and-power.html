<h2>Digital Infrastructure and Power</h2>

<p>
Digital infrastructure includes the physical and logical systems that enable modern communication: data centers, network cables, routing systems, platforms, and protocols. These systems determine how information flows and who can influence that flow.
</p>

<h3>Control of Infrastructure</h3>

<p>
Ownership and control of infrastructure matter. Entities that operate networks, platforms, or services have the ability to set rules, prioritize traffic, limit access, or collect data. These decisions shape the digital environment long before users interact with it.
</p>

<p>
Even when services appear neutral, infrastructure choices reflect economic, technical, and organizational constraints.
</p>

<h3>Centralization and Dependency</h3>

<p>
Many digital services rely on a small number of providers for hosting, analytics, identity, or content delivery. This centralization creates efficiencies but also concentrates influence and introduces single points of failure.
</p>

<p>
Outages, policy changes, or access restrictions can ripple widely across dependent systems.
</p>

<h3>Protocols and Standards</h3>

<p>
Protocols define how systems communicate. Open standards allow interoperability and transparency, while proprietary systems can limit visibility and control. These design choices affect who can participate and how easily alternatives can exist.
</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>
Power in digital systems is often structural rather than visible. It emerges from architecture, incentives, and defaults rather than explicit commands.
</p>

<p>
Understanding infrastructure helps explain why certain outcomes repeat across platforms and why meaningful change is often slow and difficult.
