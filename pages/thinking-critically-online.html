<h2>Thinking Critically Online</h2>

<p>
Critical thinking online involves evaluating information, understanding context, and recognizing incentives behind digital content. The speed and volume of online information make this increasingly important.
</p>

<h3>Evaluating Sources</h3>

<p>
Not all information is created equal. Consider who created a piece of content, why it exists, and what evidence supports it. Authority, transparency, and consistency are key indicators.
</p>

<p>
Repetition and popularity do not guarantee accuracy.
</p>

<h3>Understanding Platform Incentives</h3>

<p>
Platforms are not neutral conduits. Their design choices influence what is amplified, suppressed, or ignored. Engagement-driven systems reward content that spreads quickly, not necessarily content that is correct.
</p>

<h3>Emotional Awareness</h3>

<p>
Content that triggers strong emotions is more likely to be shared. Recognizing emotional reactions can create space for reflection before responding or spreading information further.
</p>

<h3>Slowing Down</h3>

<p>
Critical thinking often requires slowing the pace of consumption. Pausing, cross-checking, and resisting immediate reactions improve judgment and understanding.
</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>
The ability to think critically online supports informed decision-making and healthier digital environments. It shifts agency back to individuals within complex systems.
