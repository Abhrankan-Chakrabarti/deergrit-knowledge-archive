<h2>Surveillance Basics</h2>

<p>
Surveillance refers to the systematic monitoring, collection, and analysis of information about individuals or groups. In digital systems, surveillance can occur at multiple layers simultaneously.
</p>

<h3>Network-Level Observation</h3>

<p>
Internet traffic passes through service providers, routers, and exchange points. These entities can observe connection times, data volumes, and destination addresses, even if content is encrypted.
</p>

<p>
This information can be logged for operational, security, or regulatory purposes.
</p>

<h3>Platform-Level Monitoring</h3>

<p>
Applications and platforms often record user activity internally. Messages sent, content viewed, interactions made, and relationships formed may all be stored.
</p>

<p>
Policies determine how long this data is retained and who can access it, but users typically have limited visibility into these processes.
</p>

<h3>State and Corporate Roles</h3>

<p>
Surveillance is not limited to governments. Corporations collect data for analytics, personalization, and monetization. States may access data through legal frameworks, partnerships, or infrastructure control.
</p>

<p>
These roles can overlap, creating complex data ecosystems.
</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>
Surveillance affects privacy, autonomy, and freedom of expression. Even when not actively abused, the awareness of being observed can influence behavior.
</p>

<p>
Understanding surveillance as a structural feature of modern systems helps contextualize debates about privacy and security.
