<h2>How the Internet Works</h2>

<p>
The internet is not a single entity or machine. It is a global system made up of many independent networks that agree to communicate using shared rules, known as protocols.
</p>

<p>
When you access a website, your device does not connect directly to a distant computer in a simple, straight line. Instead, data is broken into small pieces called packets. These packets travel through routers operated by internet service providers, data centers, and network operators across the world.
</p>

<h3>Servers and Clients</h3>

<p>
Most internet activity follows a client–server model. Your device acts as a client, requesting information. The server stores and delivers that information. Servers can range from personal machines to massive data centers containing thousands of computers.
</p>

<p>
This separation allows services to scale, but it also centralizes control. Whoever owns or operates a server has influence over what data is stored, how it is delivered, and what logs are kept.
</p>

<h3>Routing and Infrastructure</h3>

<p>
Routers decide where packets go next based on network conditions and routing tables. This means data often takes unpredictable paths. Two requests sent seconds apart may travel through entirely different countries.
</p>

<p>
Physical infrastructure still matters. Fiber-optic cables, undersea links, and exchange points form the backbone of the internet. Despite the digital appearance, the internet depends on very real, physical systems.
</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>
Understanding the structure of the internet helps explain why outages occur, how censorship is implemented, and why privacy is not guaranteed by default. The design favors connectivity and efficiency, not anonymity.
</p>

<p>
Technologies like Tor attempt to change how routing works, but they still operate on top of the same underlying global network.
